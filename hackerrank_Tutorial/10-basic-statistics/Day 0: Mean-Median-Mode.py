"""Objective, In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, and mode.
# Task
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines.
 If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer),
your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3, 7.0 format).

Example:
N = 6
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
The mean is 20/6 = 3.3.
The median is 3+4/2 3.5.
The mode is 5 because 5 occurs most frequently.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe the arrayâ€™s elements.

Sample Input:
10
64630 11735 14216 99233 14470 4978 73429 38120 51135 67060

Sample Output:
43900.6
44627.5
4978

""" Median:
To calculate the median, we need the elements of the array to be sorted in either non-increasing or non-decreasing order
The sorted array X = {4978, 11735, 14216, 14470, 38120, 51135, 64630, 67060, 73429, 99233}.
